// A client can save its config while deja is editing it: Claude Code rewrites
// ~/.claude.json while it runs, and `deja install` is often run from inside
// it. writeIfChanged builds the new file from what the writer read and renames
// it into place, so a save that landed in between was put back by the rename,
// silently (#4561). The install lock only orders deja against deja, and a lock
// file the client does not honour orders nothing.
//
// So the file is read again just before it is replaced. If it is no longer what
// the writer read, nothing is written and the target is edited again from the
// client's version.

// readBytes is what readConfig last read of each path during an install or
// uninstall run, as it was on disk; nil for a file that was not there. Outside
// a run — doctor, the MCP server — nothing is kept.
