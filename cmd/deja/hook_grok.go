// harness deja wires sends snake_case — sessionId, workspaceRoot,
// transcriptPath, toolName, toolInput, measured on 1.0.5. Only cwd and prompt
// happen to be spelled the same, which is why grok looked wired: the recall it
// produced was for the right project and the right question, under no session
// at all.
//
// A session with no name of its own shares the empty key in the dedup ledger
// with every other session on the machine, so the second grok session looks
// like it has already been shown everything the first one was, and a compaction
// forgets nothing because there is nothing filed under its name.
//
// The structs below embed this one, so a payload decodes into both spellings at
// once, and each adopts grok's where the common spelling arrived empty.
