// An agent's own transcript is in the index while it is still being written, so
// the best lexical match for a question asked mid-session can be the question:
// recall answered with the caller's own opening prompt and left the session
// that holds the answer off the page entirely (#3945, #3965).
//
// The prompt hook has always dropped it, because a hook payload names the
// session it came from (hook_prompt.go). The MCP tool is handed no such thing —
// the connection id is minted per process and joins to nothing — so the two
// surfaces disagreed about whose session it was.
//
// What the hooks know, they now write down: every hook that carries a session
// id stamps it here, and the MCP surfaces read the stamps back. A session
// stamped in the last few minutes is one an agent is inside right now, which is
// the one thing recall must not answer with.
//
// Kept beside the index rather than in it, the way the hook cache and the
// injection log are: this is state about the machine's running agents, not
// content, and a rebuild must not wait on it or carry it.
